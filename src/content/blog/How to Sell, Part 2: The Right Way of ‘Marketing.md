> I’m not here to sell. I’m here to meet needs. The market asks, I deliver.

## Meeting Needs

In [How to Sell, Part 1](how-to-sell-part-1-navigating-the-funnel-from-strangers-to-clients), we explored how to guide strangers through a funnel until they become paying clients. But long-term success in business doesn’t just come from selling better — it comes from knowing your client inside and out. If your approach boils down to guesswork (“Hmm, I think the market wants this?”), brace yourself for a ride of disappointment.

In this post, we’ll discuss how to co-create offers with your audience — how to engage them, get feedback, and build products or services that resonate so deeply that selling becomes natural.

## How we used to do it

Many entrepreneurs, especially old school, go all-in on in-person networking. Sure, face-to-face connections can be meaningful — nobody denies the power of a handshake. But if your potential audience is in the millions online, spending days chasing a handful of people in physical meetups might not move the needle.

## How we will do it

1. Connect with your audience where they already hang out.
2. Listen to their struggles and hopes.
3. Co-create offers based on real feedback.
4. Launch with confidence because you already know it meets a need.

Think of it as **collaborative cooking:** Instead of guessing your dinner guests’ favorite dish, you ask them for their preferences while you cook. Fewer wasted ingredients, fewer disappointed palates, and less stress all around.

## Getting into the Conversation

The beauty of today’s internet is that your market already exists in corners of social media like Twitter, YouTube, Facebook Groups, etc., or specialized forums. Here’s how to tap into that:

1. **Find Traffic Hotspots**

   - Identify popular groups or pages filled with people who match your ideal customer profile.

2. **Observe, Don’t Pounce**

   - Before you blurt out a sales pitch, watch how people interact. What do they complain about? What sparks heated debate?

3. **Join Discussions**

   - Ask open-ended questions: “Has anyone tried cold messaging? What were your results?”
   - Share your viewpoint, but don’t shove it down people’s throats.

4. **Document Pain Points**

   - Keep a running list of the problems, obstacles, and frustrations they mention.
   - Divide them into main and sub-ideas, then think about how your solution addresses each.

## Converting Conversations into Offers

After gathering enough insights, it’s time to co-create your offers:

1. **Refine, Don’t Rush**

   - Draft a proposal or product concept.
   - Check if it truly addresses the pains you’ve heard.

2. **Post Follow-Up Content**

   - Summarize your findings: “Last week, many of you mentioned struggling with lead generation. Here’s a quick guide I put together…”
   - Ask for feedback. Tag people who contributed good insights.

3. **Introduce Solutions Softly**

   - If your new service or product is relevant, mention it. “By the way, I’m testing a tool that automates email outreach — would love some beta testers!”
   - If the market resonates, you’ll know: people will sign up, comment, or message you.

## Building a Community (and a Brand)

As you engage consistently and offer real solutions, you’ll cultivate a community that not only believes in your vision but feels part of it. These individuals become your best ambassadors — spreading the word and providing social proof in places you can’t reach.

Eventually, you’ll have enough momentum to consider advanced branding steps — like a polished website or paid ads — but do yourself a favor: learn from your community first. It saves you from pouring money into a sleek design that nobody cares about.

## The Secret Sauce

> “Iteration is the mother of invention.” — (Slightly misquoting necessity, but you get the idea.)

You’ll never hit perfection on the first try. The marketing greats — from startups to giant corporations — continually refine. They gather feedback, analyze data, and listen. Each post, each conversation is another puzzle piece. Over time, you’ll see the full picture.

Keep your approach simple. Don’t aim to launch the next global brand overnight.

### The Three Content Types That Work

Imagine your marketing as a balanced meal. You’ve got proteins, carbs, and veggies — each serving a unique purpose. Similarly, in your content strategy, mix three content types:

1. **Action Content**

   - Talks about objections, proof, and your offers. It gives people a direct path to decide if they want to buy.
   - Example: “Here’s a real-life case study of how our service helped X company save 30% in costs.”

2. **Connection Content**

   - Builds empathy and relatability: personal stories and inspirational messages.
   - Example: A short anecdote about how you once struggled to make your first online sale — until you discovered a specific tactic.

3. **Insight Content**
   - Industry-related info, debunking myths, sharing solutions.
   - Example: “[The KPI That Many CEOs Miss](how-to-sell-part-3-the-kpi-that-many-ceos-miss)”

A common trap is to lean too heavily on one content type:

- **All insight:** You become a library — helpful but not necessarily converting customers.
- **All connection:** People love your personality but have no clue what you actually sell.
- **All action:** Your feed looks like a never-ending billboard, pushing everyone away.

## Wrapping Up

The key to marketing is not tricking people into buying — it’s collaborating with them so they see the value in buying on their own terms. Approach every conversation with curiosity rather than an agenda. Post content that informs, connects, and drives action in a balanced measure. Offer genuine solutions, and let the market guide your refinements.

Before long, you’ll have a community that trusts you, a suite of offers that practically sell themselves, and a brand story that speaks louder than any ad campaign. Because when you’re not just “here to sell” but “here to meet needs” — that’s when the magic happens.
