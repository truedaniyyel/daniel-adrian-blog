> Success in marketing isn’t about selling — it’s about building relationships that turn total strangers into loyal clients.

## More Than Just Selling

In a world where consumers can buy nearly anything at the tap of a smartphone, selling isn’t just about forcing products down people’s throats. It’s about relationships — building trust brick by brick until total strangers are willing to take that next step.

I like to imagine a professional marketer’s day as something akin to a chef’s. Sure, you’ve got your fancy gadgets (analytics dashboards, ad platforms, social media schedulers). But if your recipe is off — if you forget the most essential ingredients — your dish falls flat. In marketing terms, it means your funnel stalls.

Let’s look at how to construct a funnel that works, and how to understand return on ad spend (ROAS) and customer acquisition cost (CAC) without needing a PhD in mathematics.

## From Strangers to Clients

Nobody wakes up and says, “I’m going to throw money at a random company I’ve never heard of.” They go through stages:

1. **Strangers:** People who don’t know you at all. They’re just folks going about life, scrolling through cat videos and possibly your ad — if you’re lucky.
2. **Audience:** Strangers who found you interesting enough to follow, like, or subscribe. Think of them as casual observers at a concert who like the opening act.
3. **Community:** They’re the ones commenting, sharing your content, maybe tagging friends. They’re also called ‘leads’ — folks who are warming up to your brand.
4. **Prospects:** On the fence but considering a purchase. They might be reading your reviews, pricing, or features.
5. **Clients:** The holy grail. They’ve pulled out their wallets or authorized the credit card. They’re in!

**Rule #1:** People move from one stage to the next. You can’t expect a random bystander to morph into a loyal client overnight. Skip the relationship-building, and you’ll watch your funnel crumble like a poorly constructed house of cards — each card a hope or wish that never got grounded in reality.

## ROAS and CAC in Plain English

When you see acronyms like **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend) and **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost), you might imagine some nightmarishly complicated formulas. But think of them this way:

- **ROAS** answers the question: “For every dollar I spend on ads, how many dollars do I get back in revenue?”
- **CAC** is simply: “How much money do I spend, on average, to earn one paying customer?”

A good ROAS is like planting a dollar and watching five dollars sprout (a 5.0 ROAS). A high CAC, on the other hand, means you’re practically throwing handfuls of cash into a campfire for every customer you get.

**Rule #2:** Always keep an eye on these two numbers. They help you spot inefficiencies and decide where to shift your budget.

## Real-World Example

Let’s say your company tested two big advertising platforms: Facebook and Google.

- **Facebook Ads** (Top of Funnel)
- **Google Ads** (Bottom of Funnel)

| Month | Channel  | Spend   | Rev     | ROAS | Purchases | CAC   |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| March | Total    | $10,000 | $35,000 | 3.5  | 200       | $50.0 |
|       | Facebook | $6,000  | $15,000 | 2.5  | 90        | $66.7 |
|       | Google   | $4,000  | $20,000 | 5.0  | 110       | $36.4 |

Suppose you spent $4,000 on Google Ads and made $20,000 in returns (a 5.0 ROAS) versus spending $6,000 on Facebook Ads with a $15,000 return (2.5 ROAS). At first glance, Google wins — most companies aim for a lower CAC to maximize profits.

In our case, over two months (April, May) company desided to increase spending on both Facebook and Google ads.

Here’s the twist:

| Month | Channel  | Spend   | Rev     | ROAS | Purchases | CAC    |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ---- | --------- | ------ |
| April | Total    | $12,000 | $40,000 | 3.3  | 220       | $54.5  |
|       | Facebook | $7,000  | $16,000 | 2.3  | 80        | $87.5  |
|       | Google   | $5,000  | $24,000 | 4.8  | 140       | $35.7  |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ---- | --------- | ------ |
| May   | Total    | $15,000 | $45,000 | 3.0  | 240       | $62.5  |
|       | Facebook | $8,000  | $18,000 | 2.3  | 70        | $114.3 |
|       | Google   | $7,000  | $27,000 | 3.9  | 170       | $41.2  |

- Google Ads nearly caught up in spending.
- Facebook's returns decreased from 2.5 to 2.3 in Paid ROAS.
- Google's Paid ROAS remained stable until May where it “slightly” dipped from 5.0 to 3.9.

### Why?

Because, **Facebook sits at the top of the funnel**, capturing attention. It helps people learn about your brand for the first time. **Google sits at the bottom**, where they search for you specifically or for solutions you offer. If you neglect Facebook, the ‘top of your funnel’ dries up. Fewer people become aware of you, fewer search for you on Google, and eventually, your Google returns suffer, too.

**Rule #3:** Platforms feed into each other. If you only optimize the bottom, you risk forgetting the all-important top.

## Offers That Move People Through the Funnel

How do you actually move people from stage to stage? Simple: you make the right offers at the right time.

1. **Strangers + Content = Audience**

   - Content can be blog posts, YouTube videos, or social media updates. It’s the spark that turns “Who are you?” into “I like what you’re saying.”

2. **Audience + Lead Magnet = Community**

   - A lead magnet is a valuable freebie—like a free eBook, webinar, or template. It’s a fair exchange: they get something helpful, you get permission to keep in touch.

3. **Community + Conversation = Prospect**

   - Conversations might be direct messages, emails, or live Q&A sessions. They build trust and show you’re not just a faceless brand — you’re a person who cares.

4. **Prospect + Core Offer = Client**

   - Core offer is your product or service, the reason your company exists. Sell it well, and a prospect becomes a paying customer.

**Rule #4:** “Right time + Right offer + Right people = Next stage.”

## Common Pitfalls

If your funnel looks more like a straw with holes in it, you might be making these mistakes:

- **Wrong Offer, Wrong Stage:** Pitching your main product to strangers is like proposing marriage on the first date.

- **Not Enough People at the Top:** If you’re not bringing in new strangers, your funnel quickly runs dry.

- **Skipping the Relationship:** People rarely buy without first seeing social proof, reading testimonials, or having some interaction.

**Rule #5:** Marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. Trying to brute-force everyone into becoming clients might yield quick wins, but it won’t last.

## Wrapping Up

Just like a great host greets guests with tasty snacks that spark curiosity, your content grabs attention with a friendly hello that makes your audience lean in and wonder what’s coming next.

Once the vibe is set, offer a little taste of what you’re really about — a lead magnet that shows off your best flavors. Think of it like a sample platter that makes your guests go, “Yes, this is exactly what I’ve been waiting for.”

As the evening rolls on, real conversation builds trust and connection. This is your chance to get to know your guests, answer their questions, and show that behind every offer is a real person who cares.

Finally, when your guests are fully into the experience and their appetites are fired up, your core offer arrives at just the right moment — fulfilling, memorable, and leaving them wanting more.

Timing and the overall vibe are everything. Lead your audience through a well-planned journey, and when it’s time for the main course, they won’t just be ready — they’ll be pumped.
